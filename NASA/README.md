[**NASA Earth Observatory:**](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/global-maps) Pre-made global map animations from satellite observations in mov format. Data can be found on oceans, land and atmosphere. In addition to pre-made animation, the data can also be downloaded as CSV files. 

[**NASA GISS:**](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/) Data and pre-made visualizations of both climate simulations and earth observations. The content varies between different topics, but all the figures have downloading options for the figure itself and sometimes also for the gridded data as CSV. 

[**NASA AERONET:**](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/) Station-specific ground observations regarding aerosols and ocean colour. The site offers some pre-view options and data can be downloaded as LEV files.
