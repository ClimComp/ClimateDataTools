Pangeo stores CMIP6 data in cloud data catalogs. You can use Python to access and download data from this cloud storage (Pangeoâ€™s site has also multiple example codes). 

- arctic_anomalies.ipynb - env1.yml
- tas anomaly animations - env3.yml (contains xesmf-package that doesn't work on Windows)
- rest of the CMIP6 examples - env2.yml
